You will configure your HPVS instance to use an **_IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services_** (HPCS) instance for key generation.  The HPCS instance provides the security of a _FIPS 140-2 level 4_-certified _Hardware Security Module_, which is the strongest level of FIPS 140-2 certification commercially available.\n",

The large majority of the commands will be run from within the Jupyter notebook while a small number of commands will be run from the terminal. Those commands that prompt for user input are run from the terminal, while the vast majority, which don't prompt for user input, are run from within Jupyter Notebook."

Which 64 human-readable characters were chosen?  Lowercase alphabetic characters a-z for 26, uppercase alphabetic characters A-Z for 26 more, the digits 0-9 for 10 more, which gives us 62.

    "1. Choose `Register` since you won't have an existing account on the newly deployed server.\n",

    "### Step 8.2 Wallet initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "It's time to set up your Secure Electrum Bitcoin wallet itself!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bring up the wallet screen\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Wallet Start](Bitcoin_Wallet_Images/Click_Wallet_Start.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enter in a `password` for your wallet and click `Create Wallet`\n",

    "3. Load your newly created wallet to enable it\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Load Wallet](Bitcoin_Wallet_Images/Load_Wallet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reload the page\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Initialized Wallet](Bitcoin_Wallet_Images/Reload_new_wallet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Your wallet is ready for use in all of its glory\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Locked and Loaded Wallet](Bitcoin_Wallet_Images/Loaded_Wallet_Time.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8.3 Receiving Bitcoins\n",
    "\n",
    "A wallet without currency is blasphemy, so it's time to fill it on up with fake bitcoins.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the `Receive` section of the wallet and get the bitcoin wallet address.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Wallet receiving bitcoin](Bitcoin_Wallet_Images/Receiving_bitcoin.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    *This is the address whose alloted bitcoins you lay claim to.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open [this bitcoin test faucet site](https://testnet-faucet.com/btc-testnet/) [click on the link] and use it to transfer bitcoin value to the `Receiving address` in your wallet **from step 1 above**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Transfer Bitcoins](Bitcoin_Wallet_Images/Send_bitcoins_to_wallet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Instead of transacting on the \"real\" bitcoin blockchain network, we are using a [testnet](https://medium.com/myetherwallet/understanding-blockchain-changes-testnets-and-mainnets-c2171a8e835f). This means that the network participants agree that the assets on the network have no value. Testnets are used for testing changes to the network, testing applications and introducing new users to the technical aspects of network. There are testnets for many of the public blockchain networks including of course bitcoin and ethereum. Test faucets (like the one we are using) act as distributors of tokens to other users on the testnet.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Switch back to your wallet tab and go to the `History` section and then reload the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Check History](Bitcoin_Wallet_Images/Check_History_Receive_Transaction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You should now see your wallet address as the recipient of a `pending transaction` from the bitcoin testnet faucet.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![First Transaction History](Bitcoin_Wallet_Images/Transaction_History_no_confirmations.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After clicking for more information you get a detailed transaction overview\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Receive Transaction 0 Confirmations](Bitcoin_Wallet_Images/0_confirmations_block_details.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    *The number of [confirmations](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Confirmation) a block receives is the number of blocks deep the block that has included the blockchain transaction is. In other words, `1 confirmation` means that the current head block includes the transaction. `2 confirmations` means that the current head block's parent block contains the transaction and so on. The deeper the transaction is (more confirmations it has) the more mining power it would take to \"reverse history\" and undo the transaction.*\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since there are `0 confirmations` in the picture above, it means that the transaction is not yet included in a block. This is why it has no timestamp yet and its block number is listed as `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After waiting anywhere from a minute to a few minutes (depending on the current testnet traffic) you should see a confirmation on your transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *You will need to keep reloading the page for it to update. It doesn't update automatically.*\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![1 Confirmation Received](Bitcoin_Wallet_Images/1_Confirmation_Received.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    There is now a timestamp and a block number!\n",
    "\n",
    "    *As time passes more confirmations will accumulate. You can check on the `confirmations` again at the end of the lab to show yourself this (Given enough time has passed for one or more additional confirmations to occur).*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8.4 Returning Bitcoins\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you are feeling charitable you decide to transfer your testnet value back to the faucet's address.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go back to [the faucet site](https://testnet-faucet.com/btc-testnet/) and get its bitcoin address\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Faucet Address](Bitcoin_Wallet_Images/testnet_faucet_address.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Send bitcoins to faucet using `Send` section of wallet\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Send Bitcoins to Faucet](Bitcoin_Wallet_Images/Send_bitcoins_back_to_faucet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once sent you will see the `Signed transaction` information filled out on your wallet page.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Bitcoins Sent Back to Faucet](Bitcoin_Wallet_Images/bitcoin_send_transaction_output.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You can go back to the [bitcoin faucet site](https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/send.php) (you may have to refresh the page) and see the transaction as green there with a sender of your address and a transaction ID matching the one you sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Bitcoins returned to faucet](Bitcoin_Wallet_Images/transaction_giving_coins_back_to_faucet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You can view both the initial received transaction and the newly sent transaction in the `History` tab of your bitcoin wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *You have to keep reloading the page for it to update with new confirmations. If you wait long enough, eventually these transactions will gain confirmations as in the picture below*\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Both transactions with 1 confirmation](Bitcoin_Wallet_Images/both_confirmed_transactions.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. You can continue to play around with the electrum wallet before moving on.\n",
