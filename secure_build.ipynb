TLS is the same security protocol that protects most Web traffic today, but most Web interactions only require the server to be authenticated.  Mutual TLS refers to the situation where not only does the client want to ensure that the server is legitimate, but the server also wants to authenticate the identity of the client.  Your Web browser is constantly receiving server certificates and verifying them while you surf the web. Client certificates are what are used when the server wants to verify the client.  \n",

While this version of the wallet is just a proof of concept, running this type of wallet on Hyper Protect enables you to protect your digital assets from bad actors such as malicious server administrators.\n",

This means that the network participants agree that the assets on the network have no value. Testnets are used for testing changes to the network, testing applications and introducing new users to the technical aspects of network. There are testnets for many of the public blockchain networks including of course bitcoin and ethereum. Test faucets (like the one we are using) act as distributors of tokens to other users on the testnet.*\n",

    "\n",
    "    ![Check History](Bitcoin_Wallet_Images/Check_History_Receive_Transaction.png)\n",

    "    *The number of [confirmations](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Confirmation) a block receives is the number of blocks deep the block that has included the blockchain transaction is. In other words, `1 confirmation` means that the current head block includes the transaction. `2 confirmations` means that the current head block's parent block contains the transaction and so on. The deeper the transaction is (more confirmations it has) the more mining power it would take to \"reverse history\" and undo the transaction.*\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since there are `0 confirmations` in the picture above, it means that the transaction is not yet included in a block. This is why it has no timestamp yet and its block number is listed as `0`.\n",
