    "This lab will introduce you to two features of the IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers offering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Secure Build Server\n",
    "2. Bring Your Own Image, or BYOI\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial introduction of IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers (HPVS) offered an Ubuntu image which you could then tailor to your requirements, but if you wanted to replicate your changes onto other HPVS instances, you would have to repeat the custom configurations on each additional HPVS instance you acquired.  Automation tools like Ansible could help with that process, but wouldn't it be nicer if you could just deploy your custom-built Docker image, that you only had to configure once, onto an HPVS instance?  That's the convenience that the *BYOI* feature offers. It offers the ability to deploy a digitally-signed Docker image into an HPVS instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can deploy Docker images that are digitally-signed by you or some other person or organization that you (hopefully!) trust. In the case of images digitally-signed by you, the _Secure Build Server_ feature lets you build, and digitally sign, a Docker image within an HPVS instance called a _secure build server_ that offers the confidentiality, integrity and auditability protections inherent in IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will perform the main use case targeted by these two features working together:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will deploy your own secure build server in an HPVS instance\n",
    "2. You will use this secure build server to securely create and digitally sign a Docker image that contains a sample application\n",
    "3. You will deploy this Docker image that you've built in a second HPVS instance and then run the sample application contained within the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will be using an open-source application called _Juypter Notebook_ to run the lab. This application allows you to enter commands and see the results of these commands. You are likely reading this within Jupyter Notebook right now.  You will also open a terminal within Jupyter and enter some commands from the terminal. The large majority of the commands will be run from within the Jupyter notebook while a small number of commands will be run from the terminal."
