    "This lab will introduce you to two features of the IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers offering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Secure Build Server\n",
    "2. Bring Your Own Image, or BYOI\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial introduction of **_IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers_** (HPVS) offered an Ubuntu image which you could then tailor to your requirements, but if you wanted to replicate your changes onto other HPVS instances, you would have to repeat the custom configurations on each additional HPVS instance you created.  Automation tools like Ansible could help with that process, but wouldn't it be nicer if you could just deploy your custom-built Docker image, that you only had to configure once, onto an HPVS instance?  That's the convenience that the *BYOI* feature offers. It offers the ability to deploy a digitally signed Docker image into an HPVS instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can deploy Docker images that are digitally signed by you or some other person or organization that you (hopefully!) trust. In the case of images you build and sign, the _Secure Build Server_ feature lets you build, and digitally sign, a Docker image within an HPVS instance called a _secure build server_ that offers the confidentiality, integrity and auditability protections inherent in IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will perform the main use case targeted by these two features working together:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will deploy your own secure build server in an HPVS instance\n",
    "2. You will use this secure build server to securely create and digitally sign a Docker image that contains a sample application. For this lab we will use a sample _secure bitcoin wallet application_ provided by IBM for demonstration purposes.\n",
    "3. You will deploy this Docker image that you've built in a second HPVS instance and then run the sample secure bitcoin wallet application contained within the image. You will configure your HPVS instance to use an **_IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services_** (HPCS) instance for key generation.  Your HPCS instance provides the security of a _FIPS 140-2 level 4_-certified _Hardware Security Module_, which is the strongest level of FIPS 140-2 certification commercially available.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using an open-source application, called _Jupyter Notebook_, to run this lab. This application allows you to enter commands and see the results of these commands. You are likely reading this within Jupyter Notebook right now.  You will also open a terminal within Jupyter and enter some commands from the terminal. The large majority of the commands will be run from within the Jupyter notebook while a small number of commands will be run from the terminal. Those commands that prompt for user input are run from the terminal, while the vast majority, which don't prompt for user input, are run from within Jupyter Notebook."

TLS is the same security protocol that protects most Web traffic today, but most Web interactions only require the server to be authenticated.  Mutual TLS refers to the situation where not only does the client want to ensure that the server is legitimate, but the server also wants to authenticate the identity of the client.  Your Web browser is constantly receiving server certificates and verifying them while you surf the web. Client certificates are what are used when the server wants to verify the client.  \n",

You can use it to store the identities necessary to transact on the Bitcoin public blockchain network. While this version of the wallet is just a proof of concept, running this type of wallet on Hyper Protect enables you to protect your digital assets from bad actors such as malicious server administrators.\n",

Testnets are used for testing changes to the network, testing applications and introducing new users to the technical aspects of network. There are testnets for many of the public blockchain networks including of course bitcoin and ethereum. Test faucets (like the one we are using) act as distributors of tokens to other users on the testnet.*\n",

In other words, `1 confirmation` means that the current head block includes the transaction. `2 confirmations` means that the current head blocks parent block contains the transaction and so on. The deeper the transaction is (more confirmations it has) the more mining power it would take to \"reverse history\" and undo the transaction.*\n",
